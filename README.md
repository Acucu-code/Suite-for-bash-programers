Except in rare and forced cases, only internal sh commands are used; some of these scripts only work if they are included in '. script'.  The script or bash that includes other scripts also includes 'include' and 'type'.

This suite contains sh scripts designed to complement programming with
commands that mostly only use sh built-in commands, for:
- managing script inclusions (include, type)
- filtering text (shead)
- coloring/styling text (parp, tize)
- managing CPU frequency based on temperature (tempfreq, tempfreq_log)
- passing command output to a variable (varize)
- instance separator (sep)
- passing standard output to a script (tb)
- number identifier (isnum)
- number enumerator and word counter (enum)
- system terminator by time or temperature (fin)
- displaying/coloring a script's informational header (infsh)
- checking options (check)

For information about a command, it's usually enough to run it without parameters, which will display the information contained in the script header. Currently only available in Spanish.
